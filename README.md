# SignalK_raspberry_MCS
SignalK Plugin to provide MCS functionality to SignalK  

The Plugin works with Raspberry OS Buster / Bullseye / Bookworm!!  

Attention: the postinstall.js scripts need sudo privilegs!

## Overview:  
This package install all dependencies, modules and dt-overlays to provide the fully avalability of the MCS board in SignalK.  
This package only works on a Raspberry Pi with a wired GeDaD MCS (Marine Controll Server).   

https://www.gedad.de/shop/gecos-wired/#cc-m-product-15562399022  

Be careful. The postinstallationscript works with sudo acess! 

## How to install:
Install the SignalK_raspberry_MCS Plugin in the Signalk Appstore.  
After the Installation:
1. Run the postinstallscript:  
```sh
sudo node $HOME/.signalk/node_modules/signalk-raspberry-mcs/postinstall.js
```  
-- For BBN Users, use instead:  
```sh
sudo node /home/signalk/.signalk/node_modules/signalk-raspberry-mcs/postinstall.js
``` 
(This script add the dt-overlays for CAN and NMEA0183 to the config.txt, adds the modules and installs and enable the 1-wire service and the autoshutdown service)  

2. Restart your Pi!!!

=> After this steps you can use the signalK Plugin.

## How to use (Plugin)

After this all should work.. ;-)  

## How to use serial interfaces (NMEA0183)
All 6 serial interfaces should now be available in the connection tab. You find them under "Input Type" NMEA0183 , "MMEA0183Source" Serial.  
You can use each interface as "Input" or "Output"

## How to use CAN (NMEA2000) interface  

You can Setup the caninterface directly in the connections

## How to use 1-wire (DS18B20 temp sensors

You can use more then one sensor on the 1-wire line (see Manual MCS-Board)  
CLick on the add Button. Then you can define the Values of your Sensor. You can use a Sensor (Sensor ID) more then once to assign the value to more then one delta. But do not use a delta more then once!

Fully configurated Sensor:

Data output:

The sample rate should be not less then "number of sensors" x 1s = "sample rate"  

### Since the V 1.0.7 there is an additional option for "Offsets" of the DS18B20 Sensors. If you update the Plugin you must add a number like 0, else you get an error.  
The "offstes" is sum to the incomming temperature value. Means if you get a 12,2°C from the Sensor and you set an offset of -1.25 you get an result of 10,95°C.  



## How to use a digital input (IN1-IN4) for seatalk1 reading

Since the Seatalk1 GPIO reading is implimented in SignalK, you can use the inputs for ST1 reading.  
Follow the guidline in the [Seatalk(GPIO).md](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/blob/master/Seatalk(GPIO).md)  
The "Hardware and software install part you can ignore, because it´s done on the MCS board and on the install process. Only connect the yellow wire to one of the 4 inputs.  
The IN1-IN4 inputs are assignet as follows:
|MCS Input|GPIO|
| ------ | ------ |
|In1|GPIO19|
|In2|GPIO16|
|In3|GPIO26|
|In4|GPIO20|

## How to use a digital input (IN1-IN4) for state and frequency reading  
You can connect different Sensors to the IN1-IN4 as for example a switch, a bilge float or you can read fruequency with it such as Terminal W of your alternator or a sensor on the crankshaft. The kind of the Sensor is defined by the SignalK delta. If you use a delta for a state, it is handle as a state. If you use a delta for rpm,m/s or something else it is defined as a frequency.  
Here you see an example for rpm measurment and the Engine state:  
![In1-In4](/data/Picture_MCS_IN1_IN4.png)

If you not directly measure the true frequency like a alternator with a ratio or a paddle wheel, you can define a multiplier. So if you get a frequency of:  
(for info: 1000rpm/60=frequency => 16,6Hz) 
Your Engine rotates with a speed of 1000rpm (16,6Hz) and the Delta shows you 33,2Hz => you must use a multipier of 0.5

Further example:
You want to measure your boat speed with a paddle wheel. If your paddle wheel creates 6 pulses at 1m/s boat speed you have to use a multiplier of 1/6 => 0.166 Then you get directly m/s.


## General 
Don´t forget to save the plugin settings after changes. ;-)

## Todos
✓  Add plugin intigration for speed (Hz) measurement through In1-In4  
✓  Add plugin intigration for switch states (Sensors etc.) from the IN1-IN4 to map to delta´s  
- add further 1-wire sensors  
- add support for aditional hardware for the MCS  


### Changelog:

-1.0.6: Fix issue in readinputs if the inputs are empty. Fix childprocess kill in index after restart of the Plugin  
-1.0.7: Add support for temperature offset of 1-wire devices / Bug fix in readinputs when no input is set.  
-1.0.8: delete onoff dependecies, testet with Bullseye
